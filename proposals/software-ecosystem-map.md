**Intro**

At the macro level, open source software has a significantly higher return on investment than proprietary software, both in commercial and non-commercial settings.

However, OpenForum Europe's [latest study](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and) indicates that around 99 percent of the software is still developed as proprietary software.

We suggest governments tackle this issue as a [market failure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketfailure.asp) and develop long-term strategies to increase open source software adoption, such as FSFE's [Public Money, Public Code](https://publiccode.eu/) campaign.

To measure the effectiveness of these strategies, we first need to map the software ecosystem and use it as one of the Key Performance Indicators.

Keeping track of this map's changes would allow us to estimate the required time and resources to achieve specific targets.

**Goals**

The study should show the resource allocation (capital, engineering) on proprietary and open source software, at least in the following areas:

- In commercial and non-commercial applications
- Per industry

Depending on the scope, we can extend the study by technology/language, country, and other relevant categories.

The study results should be shared with the community on a public website and updated periodically.

**Existing studies and efforts**

There are already extensive reports on the software industry.

Some examples:
- Evans Data Corporation: [Worldwide Developer Population and Demographic Study 2021 v2](https://evansdata.com/reports/viewRelease.php?reportID=9)
- Synopsis: [Open Source Security And Risk Analysis Report](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/open-source-security-risk-analysis.html)
- teknowlogy Group: [Open Source: a dynamic market fueled by digital transformation and innovation](https://cnll.fr/media/2019_CNLL-Syntec-Systematic-Open-Source-Study.pdf)

Our initial step should be to explore existing studies to understand the available/missing data to build the map.

Combining this study with the existing [Software bill of materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bill_of_materials) (SBOM) efforts can also be an alternative option, e.g., the CISA [SBOM initiative](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom).

### Due diligence

<!-- Please answer the following due diligence questions; it's okay to answer "N/A" if you don't know yet. -->

1. **What related work has already been done in this area?** There are existing studies for the software industry, but no public data explicitly shows the resource allocation for proprietary and open source software.
2. **How is this proposal innovative -- what distinguishes it from other related work?** This study's results would help policymakers develop and measure the effectiveness of different long-term open source strategies.
3. **Who is your doer -- who will execute the proposed work?** An existing research organization conducting this study would be ideal, making it easier to update the results in the future. Alternatively, I plan to send proposals for the [Open source subsidy program](https://futureu.europa.eu/processes/Digital/f/15/proposals/1791?locale=en) and the [Open source public fund](https://futureu.europa.eu/processes/Digital/f/15/proposals/1364?locale=en). We can consider combining it with one of those proposals.
4. **How might this work be sustained long-term after an initial seed grant?** We expect the governments to have a dedicated branch to execute these long-term strategies (Open Source Program Offices), and finance the ongoing expenses, like updating the results of this study.

### Resources needed

Initially, we need to contact the research organizations in this space to see whether we already have the data to prepare this map. If not, we need to evaluate how much effort it would require, depending on the study's accuracy and extensiveness.
