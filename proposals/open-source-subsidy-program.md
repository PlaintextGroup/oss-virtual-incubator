### Proposal body

<!-- Explain your proposal. Add as much as you want, within reason! -->

**Intro**

Without external incentives, most companies develop their software in isolation, even if it's not about their core business. For example, OpenForum Europe's [latest study](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and) indicates that 99% of the software developed is still developed proprietary.

This over-protective approach leads companies to reinvent similar solutions rather than focus on the areas that add business value. Instead, we could substantially reduce the investment overlaps and increase efficiency by explicitly investing in open source software and pooling resources.

We suggest governments set up open source subsidy programs to offer financial incentives for companies to switch from developing proprietary to open source software.

If a company joins the program, they should receive a subsidy as a tax break or direct payment, ideally for each dedicated developer/employee, to partially cover their development costs.

The initial goal should be to encourage companies to open their non-essential software. In the long term, we should minimize proprietary and maximize open source to increase collaboration between companies and foster innovation in the software ecosystem.

**Goals**

- Expand the open source ecosystem, and establish an open source culture in the software industry by shifting from private to public solutions.
- Increase productivity by helping businesses save resources through reusable open source software.
- Maximize innovation possibilities and accelerate the economy.
- Improve digital autonomy by having more open source solutions in the market.
- Help existing open source initiatives with additional financial support.

**Principles**

- The private sector should stay the leading risk-taker. The program should cover the development costs at a minimum, for example, 1~5% level, and gradually increase the figure if necessary.
- The initial goal should be to encourage companies to open their non-essential software.
- The program should approve the subsidy based on the development activity, not the software's usage.
- The program should aim for minimum gatekeeping and be available to any company, software, or intention.
- The companies should be able to apply to the program with minimum effort.

**Study areas**

One of the core challenges of such a subsidy program would be scalability; the process should have minimal overhead and bureaucracy both for the program and the companies to reach a significant number of companies in the industry.

Therefore, our primary goal in this study is to calculate the "development activity threshold", which the program should use as a metric to standardize the subsidy approval process.

We can summarize the study areas as the following:

**Development activity threshold**: Study existing projects to see how much development activity it requires to build software on average—for example, lines of code, number of releases or commits, backlog changes. Inspecting existing repositories can help us determine an objective threshold.

**Outline of the program**: Depends on the extensiveness, investigate the program's other aspects, such as:
- The cost-benefit ratio predictions
- High-level roadmap of the program with different phases
- Effective subsidy usage strategies for maximizing the impact
- Other policy or implementation challenges

### Due diligence

<!-- Please answer the following due diligence questions; it's okay to answer "N/A" if you don't know yet. -->

1. **What related work has already been done in this area?**
- [Open source software subsidies and network compatibility in a mixed duopoly](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ebl/ecbull/eb-13-00806.html) by Mourad Zeroukhi & Thierry Pénard focuses on using different subsidy strategies to increase open-source software usage.
- [Study about the impact of open source software and hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation in the EU economy](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and) by OpenForum Europe suggests subsidizing open-source software production, especially related to economic or social value.
2. **How is this proposal innovative -- what distinguishes it from other related work?** No well-known study provides a detailed framework for implementing a subsidy program and tackling its practical challenges.
3. **Who is your doer -- who will execute the proposed work?** It may depend on the extensiveness of the study. I'm willing to take responsibility for the execution. However, the proposal contains multiple areas, and collaborating with professional research organizations can be ideal.
4. **How might this work be sustained long-term after an initial seed grant?** Providing the framework for this subsidy program should be a one-time study. The related government agencies should carry out the program's implementation if any find it feasible.

### Resources needed

A grant to allow us to carry out this study. It's possible to split the research into smaller focus areas; hence the amount could differ based on the extensiveness of the study. Providing contacts from existing research organizations would also be helpful.
