### Title

CHAOSS: Improving Policy and Decision-making as Related to open-source Health and Sustainability 

### Short description

CHAOSS is an open-source project focused on identifying critical metrics of project health and advancing these metrics through software and projects that foster healthier communities. Work in CHAOSS centers on building a shareable language and practices for understanding open-source software health and sustainability. From the CHAOSS metrics, software, and projects, essential building blocks are made publicly available for evaluating the health of open-source projects and larger open-source software ecosystems. 

Our proposed project goals will advance work in the CHAOSS project in directions that our long-standing members and newcomers view as improving policy and decision-making related to open-source health and sustainability. At its core, our proposal centers on three principles: 

Open-source projects do not live in isolation but within a collection of projects  –  an open-source software ecosystem. Therefore, Improving our understanding of open-source ecosystem health is as essential as knowing any project's health. 
Active development of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)  metrics and programs provides a collection of proven open-source project community development solutions, which will help foster healthier open-source software communities. 
Any metric alone is limited in its impact. However, constructing sets of metrics that we call metrics models, alongside the data underlying their measurement, highlights open-source community health to a wider variety and scope of open-source projects. 

Stemming from these principles, we propose three interconnected efforts, all intending to improve data, information, and guidance available for policy and decision-making as it pertains to society-level risk mitigation and organizational-level evaluation of open-source options: : 

Advancing ecosystem-level understanding of open-source project health and distinguishing characteristics across ecosystems of a) software distributed by different package managers (e.g., Python, Rust, and NPM), b) corporatized open-source infrastructure, and c) scientific open-source software. We will use machine learning and dependency analysis embedded within the CHAOSS/Augur software project. Output: Large Scale Data Set to inform policy making and a catalog of comparisons for projects in adjacent domains. 
Advancing CHAOSS diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) metrics and programs to help open-source projects best center DEI in their efforts. We will develop the CHAOSS DEI Project Badging program to identify key metrics and ensure deployment of these metrics in participating open-source projects. Output: Policy Guidance on Strategies for building sustainable open source communities. 
Building collections of CHAOSS metrics (i.e., metrics models) and providing the technical mechanisms necessary for these metrics models to be readily deployable using CHAOSS software. We will develop metric model definitions alongside implementations (i.e., Jupyter Notebooks, CHAOSS/Augur technology, and sample datasets) to ensure that provided metrics models are deployable in practice. Output: Practice informed assessment models to inform policy making.

### Proposal body

In less than 20 years, open-source has grown to represent a collection of activities and innovations now embodied in tens of thousands of open-source projects emerging from an ever-changing and dynamic landscape. In the complex setting of open-source projects, research and applied efforts are shedding light on people, conventions, resources, distribution systems, and aesthetics that define the shifting state of open-source projects in today’s modern organizational settings. In many cases, organizations assume a future for a set of projects. Still, they cannot see within or across these complex systems to assess project health and the corresponding level of risk to each project’s ecosystem.  Improving our vision of open-source project health –  the potential that an open-source project will continue developing quality software – is an essential issue for all.

The rapid growth of open-source software, combined with a limited understanding of project health, makes the absence of transparency a risk for businesses and scientific organizations alike. As a result, open-source projects sometimes go dormant, leaving a technological dust bowl in their wake for dependent projects and organizations. These risks to health and sustainability are latent and significant problems for a wide range of critical technical infrastructure.  To address these risks to health and sustainability, we extend our work found in the CHAOSS project to grow metrics, software, and programs -- to improve policy development and decision-making associated with open-source project engagement.

The CHAOSS project emerged a little over five years ago from a shared set of project-level concerns about making the health and sustainability of open-source more visible to a project’s key stakeholders. As the importance of open-source software is no longer in question, its central role in technology work raises vital questions about how we understand the health and sustainability of open-source projects. For example, unhealthy projects can negatively impact the community involved in the project, organizations that rely on the project, and society as a whole when risks are manifest within critical infrastructure.  In response, policy and decision-makers require more comprehensive data and measurements for identifying risks and opportunities associated with open-source software. For example:

Policymakers want to identify open-source ecosystems woven into critical infrastructure and establish goals for ensuring infrastructure robustness, as well as key indicators for measuring progress toward those goals. 

Open-source companies want to understand a project’s risk profile before incorporating it into its products or services. Once integrated, companies need to know which communities to engage with, communicate the organization's impact on the community, and evaluate their employees' work within open-source.

Open-source contributors want to know where they should place their efforts and know that they are making an impact.

Open-source communities want to attract new members, ensure consistent quality, and reward valuable members.

Open-source foundations want to identify and respond to community needs, evaluate the impact of their work, and promote communities.

The importance of open-source software can no longer rely on assumptions of project health. We are now at a point where data-driven decisions are required when engaging in open-source projects that power our homes, cars, media, and telecom. Our proposal aims to leverage the precision of CHAOSS metrics to make the health of open-source projects more widely available and easily understandable. Through this work, we will develop a rich, rigorously analyzable, and public collection of open-source project data on a previously unimaginable scale to help policy and decision-makers understand current states. We will also provide exemplar practices and evaluation models based on the community's open-source, comprehensive knowledge and perspective that developed existing CHAOSS metrics and tools. These two dimensions are complementary. 


Figure 1 - Individual projects are concerned about their health and sustainability. The CHAOSS project holds data for dozens of ecosystems and has developed health and sustainability models used within projects and ecosystems. CHAOSS also shepherds programs that help advance individual projects' sustainability. This proposal aims to consolidate and scale existing data, knowledge, and tools into a rich collection of data, evaluation models, and practices to guide open-source policymakers.

Concerning the current proposal, we aim to advance three key projects with CHAOSS: (1) developing CHAOSS software to map open-source software ecosystems and identify areas of critical concern within a specified ecosystem, and (2) advancing CHAOSS diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) metrics and programs to help open-source projects best center DEI in their efforts, and (3) building collections of CHAOSS metrics (i.e., metrics models) and making these collections deployable through CHAOSS software.

Each of the three projects leverages the CHAOSS Project's established community and technology in specific ways to catalyze adjacent corporate, university, and non-government organization open-source software initiatives. Proposed outputs of the three projects include:
We will create a large-scale data lake aimed at consolidating data from dozens of open source ecosystems and over 100,000 repositories to make data for policy making available. We will also provide insights from Augur’s machine learning and other techniques at a scale previously not possible.    
We will provide policy guidance on diversity, equity, and inclusion practices that make open-source projects more sustainable. This guidance will emerge from existing CHAOSS metric collections, processes, and collaborations that enable open-source software projects to accomplish goals of more diverse, equitable, and inclusive communities without placing a significant strain on often overloaded project maintainers.
We will deploy policy-directed computational models (metrics models) to analyze our data lake. These metrics models are derived from open-source best practices and will enable policymakers to make data-driven choices for the direction of resources aimed at securing critical infrastructure. 

Outcomes of the three projects include:
This project will fundamentally alter how policymakers, the general population, open-source newcomers, and critical business, university, and organizational decision-makers understand open-source software. Our catalyzing demonstration will include maps of five different, substantial open-source software ecosystems, including at least one from corporatized open-source software, scientific open-source software, and non-government organization (NGO) open-source software.
This project will help policymakers understand which strategies are most effective for developing sustainable open source communities. This outcome centers on identifying policies that enable open-source software projects to improve their health and sustainability by centering their organizing principles around DEI. In addition, we will develop an active, functional DEI Project Badging program that incorporates peer review and constructive feedback to help open-source software project maintainers earn and promote credit for their DEI efforts. This outcome builds on the CHAOSS DEI Event badging program's principles.
This project will make open-source software more accessible to newcomers and make newcomers' needs and desires more understandable for open-source software project maintainers.
This project will increase individual and organizational engagement in open-source software projects. The outcome is enabled by human-centered design and deployment of CHAOSS metrics models.

**Project 1: Ecosystem Health and Sustainability.**
In almost all areas of open-source software, from package-managed libraries to core corporatized infrastructure and scientific software, our ability to manage and navigate the complexity of open-source ecosystems is limited. While the importance of open-source software is widely acknowledged across research communities, the creation, development, and maintenance of open-source software varies across and within distinct ecosystems. Moreover, the interdependencies between software and the work undertaken and needed to sustain open-source software at an ecosystem level are nearly invisible. In response, we will build on the work of the CHAOSS community to make the identification of the properties of open-source software ecosystems more visible by mapping known software and critical interdependencies so that we can all better discuss, analyze, coordinate, and improve our software-dependent work. Specifically, we will identify and target two big problems in open-source software ecosystems:

Discovery: Identifying related open-source software components is ad-hoc, leading to an unclear picture of software in an ecosystem.

Health Assessment: Software can be available without a healthy, active contributor community to keep it functional and synchronized with software. The software can create problems in the supply chain of nearby open-source software projects without sustained effort. These characteristics include identifying ecosystem-level elements that correspond with reliability, safety, security, inclusivity, and what might generally be described as health trajectories.

As users coalesce around open-source software toolchains, support and skill flow coalesce, generating beneficial and stabilizing network effects. Suppose open-source software developers and maintainers know who is using the software and how it is used in workflows and infrastructure. This will help ensure compatibility with nearby software and anticipate the future software needs of cutting-edge projects.

A clearer understanding of dependencies and patterns of use in software makes local ecosystems more able to compose software from smaller packages. Smaller, specialized packages increase “option value” or the innovative potential from recombination. An increased option value can help fix problems or provide new capabilities in fewer locations.

The first part of this project will scale the dependency analysis and machine learning components of the CHAOSS/Augur software project. Specifically, we will engage the CHAOSS community in an iterative process of identifying critical sub-ecosystems in package-managed libraries, core corporatized infrastructure, and scientific software. We will then scale CHAOSS/Augur’s existing machine learning algorithms to discover, assess, and identify ecosystem-level characteristics that generate an ecosystem map. The map will substantially accelerate the open-source community writ large’s ability to find opportunities for improvement and models of practice that are effective in similar ecosystems and sub-ecosystems.

The second part of this project will identify specific metrics and metrics models necessary to identify critical health concerns within a mapped ecosystem.  Scaling the application of CHAOSS/Augur’s machine learning capabilities will reveal characteristics and similarities within and across projects within an ecosystem. Specifically, Augur takes a collection of projects defined by the user and conducts local and global clustering analysis, topic modeling, discourse analysis (parts of speech in issues, pull requests, and associated comments), message novelty, message sentiment, probabilistic evaluation of a pull request’s likelihood of acceptance, and anomaly detection (i.e., acceleration and deceleration of distinct types of project and ecosystem activity against a normed model built from a configurable training period).

**Project 2: Centering DEI.** A key component of CHAOSS is the development of DEI metrics to help us and others best center DEI within their projects. Improving open-source work and the DEI share a common geography. For open-source community health, the key to aligning our efforts lies in the application of research and practice illustrating how advancing DEI within open-source communities enables us to overcome key open-source challenges from new perspectives. More productive teams and healthier communities will emerge through this recognition, new points of view, and a growing understanding that open-source software faces shared challenges advanced through new alignments.

We will draw our work forward in a new CHAOSS DEI Project Badging Program to help others better center DEI in their communities. In particular, we will help other community members consider (1) challenges in centering DEI in globally distributed and culturally diverse communities, (2)  a focus on new and existing contributor retention as critical for better centering DEI with an open-source project, and (3) that any DEI reflection is not always about end goals but can serve as inspiration for a community as a whole.

The first part of this project will identify necessary CHAOSS metrics used to help center DEI at a project level. This work will extend current CHAOSS efforts in developing metrics and metrics models necessary for open-source project maintainers and community ways to improve their experiences.

The second part of this project will develop an open and transparent application and review process through which open-source projects can request DEI Project Badges for accomplishing specific, measurable goals that demonstrate progress toward centering DEI within their projects. This work will build from our current DEI Event Badging program that has badged over 40 open-source events in their efforts to best center DEI within their events. In doing so, the CHAOSS project can help open-source projects consider DEI an essential part of building and sustaining healthy open-source projects.

**Project 3: Metrics Models.** To date, CHAOSS has developed over 70 health and sustainability metrics in project risk, evolution, value, and DEI. The metrics provide standard definitions around health and sustainability concerns such as issue age, contributor volume, and license coverage. Yet, we have found that each metric in isolation is limited in its ability to build knowledge of health and sustainability. In response, CHAOSS members have begun assembling metrics collections or models to provide more meaning to any individual metric. Such models include project responsiveness, contributor retention, and DEI within a project.

Our exploration of metrics models is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks. We have the technical mechanics for building metrics models through a robust pilot phase. To advance metrics models to meet demand, we need to provide a well-designed user interface that pairs the models with CHAOSS software and CHAOSS programs to enable easy deployment for people and organizations. By pairing metrics models with CHAOSS software and programs, we improve access to critical health and sustainability knowledge that enables open-source program offices, technology companies, project maintainers, and other stakeholders demand. These insights, when consolidated and applied across multiple ecosystems enable policymakers to quickly use metrics models to answer new questions in evolving project contexts.  

The first part of this project includes developing and distributing metrics models that help people, communities, and organizations best consider how their available data can be drawn together in meaningful and actionable ways to improve the health of open-source communities of interest. Metrics models can include such concerns as project responsiveness, project engagement, member burnout, and community welcomingness.

The second part of this project includes deploying metrics models for people, communities, and organizations looking to immediately understand how metrics models apply to their communities of interest. This will consist of integration with the CHAOSS Augur software in making metrics models live through web and mobile interfaces -- making open-source community health questions and answers more immediately available than they currently are.


### Due diligence

<!-- Please answer the following due diligence questions; it's okay to answer "N/A" if you don't know yet. -->

1. **What related work has already been done in this area?** All the proposed project work exists in pieces with the CHAOSS project.

In the case of ecosystem health and sustainability, CHAOSS/Augur has already developed and tuned the dependency analysis and machine learning algorithms and run them on repository collections up to 3,500.

In the case of centering DEI, numerous CHAOSS DEI metrics have been released around event diversity, leadership & governance, and project & community. Further, the CHAOSS DEI Event Badging Program has issued over 50 badges to events working to improve their own DEI efforts. Yet, work needs to be done to advance our CHAOSS DEI project-level efforts.

In the case of metrics models, no metrics models have been released, nor have they been tied to existing software or programs. Yet, over 70 CHAOSS metrics exist from which to build metrics models. Our metrics and software work's success drive demand for metrics models.

2. **How is this proposal innovative -- what distinguishes it from other related work?** The proposal builds from the solid base that the CHAOSS project provides. It is determined from other related work as the CHAOSS project is the leading open-source project focused on open-source community health and sustainability. Our position in the open-source landscape sets us apart as a community with members from industry, academia, and funding agencies focused on improving open-source communities' health and sustainability.

The particular projects are innovative as they advance prior efforts within the CHAOSS project and start to place them in front of people who want easy and quick views of open-source community health and sustainability, as informed by years of community research. The projects will move the CHAOSS work from articulated documents to activities in practice available for all. We’ve built the base; now we are putting the base into practice for broad audiences.

As a whole, each project in this proposal contributes to scaling CHAOSS standards and software so they can answer more significant questions, contribute to the development of ecosystem-level maps, and be more easily applied by a larger community of open-source stakeholders.

3. **Who is your doer -- who will execute the proposed work?** The doers include the authors of this proposal as well as CHAOSS community members engaged in different projects described here. Further, funds would be used to support two graduate students and one graphic design consultant.

4. **How might this work be sustained long-term after an initial seed grant?** Members of the proposing team have been long-term contributors to open-source community health and sustainability efforts. Our work has been funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Mozilla, the National Science Foundation, and several for-profit organizations. We are experienced in partnering with external funding organizations - understanding the goals of funding for all the parties involved. Our efforts not only include the aforementioned projects in this proposal but the ongoing securing of external financial support to ensure the longevity of the CHAOSS project.
